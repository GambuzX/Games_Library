# Games Library :video_game:  :file_folder:

Program developed during the curricular unit AEDA as a two-part project.

The first part's objective was to make use of the following concepts in C++: 
* classes
* inheritance and polymorphism
* exceptions
* files
* **sorting**
* **search**
* **linear structures**
* documentation

In the second part we had to implement new features using the following **non-linear data structures**:
* binary search trees
* priority queue
* hash table

#### **First Part Grade: ??**
